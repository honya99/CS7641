    • For this assignment, I used a frozen lake library and a mountain car library which can be found here: https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/ and https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/classic_control/mountain_car/
    • My code and notebooks can be found here: https://github.com/honya99/CS7641/tree/main/Assignment4
    • The code can be run through the Jupiter notebooks by running all of the cells.
