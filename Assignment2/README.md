For this assignment, I analyzed heart attack data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nareshbhat/health-care-data-set-on-heart-attack-possibility?select=heart.csv)
My code and notebooks can be found here: https://github.com/honya99/CS7641/tree/main/Assignment2
The code can be run through the Jupiter notebooks by running all of the cells.
