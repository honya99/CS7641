For this assignment, I used two separate Jupiter notebooks. One for analyzing heart attack data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nareshbhat/health-care-data-set-on-heart-attack-possibility?select=heart.csv) and the other for analyzing hotel reservation data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset)
My code and notebooks can be found here: https://github.com/honya99/CS7641/tree/main/Assignment3
The code can be run through the Jupiter notebooks by running all of the cells.
